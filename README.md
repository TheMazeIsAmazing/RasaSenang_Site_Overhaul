## Restaurant website for Programming 5

For the 5th programming course I decided to remake the website for a previous client. The course required the use of Laravel, so that's what I used...

Features include:
- Placing a reservation
- Adding new dishes to the menu
- Adding new ingredients
- Highlighting Dishes
- User reviews (Including check to ensure that they've visited the restaurant before)


**Archived:** The client and I could not agree on the price, so I stopped development. But there was room to redo the reservation system again (and make it more secure and stuff), so I continued development in: https://github.com/TheMazeIsAmazing/Reserveringssysteem-Rasa-V2
